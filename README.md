## Learning Sections

### 1. Introduction & Setup Labs

Introduces Terraform fundamentals, installation procedures, CLI usage, and environment configuration.
Labs focus on initialization workflows, providers, validation, and establishing a working development setup required for infrastructure provisioning.

---

### 2. Deploying Infrastructure with Terraform

Hands-on deployment of infrastructure resources across cloud environments.
Covers resource blocks, execution plans, dependency handling, lifecycle operations, and iterative provisioning practices to reinforce reproducible infrastructure management.

---

### 3. Read, Create, Modify Configurations

Explores infrastructure lifecycle management by updating and maintaining configurations.
Learners practice reading state, modifying resources, understanding idempotency, and managing configuration evolution through controlled change execution.

---

### 4. Terraform Provisioners

Examines usage of local and remote provisioners for post-deployment configuration tasks.
Includes practical examples and highlights best practices, limitations, and recommended alternatives to maintain maintainable and scalable infrastructure workflows.

---

### 5. Terraform Modules & Workspaces

Focuses on reusable infrastructure architecture through modules and environment separation via workspaces.
Covers structure design, variable inputs/outputs, versioning, and multi-environment deployment strategies.

---

### 6. Remote State Management

Demonstrates centralized state storage and collaboration-safe workflows.
Includes backend configuration, state locking, migration techniques, and collaborative infrastructure management patterns.

---

### 7. Security

Introduces security-focused Terraform practices including secret handling, variable protection, access control models, and secure backend configuration aligned with production-grade governance expectations.

---

### 8. Terraform Cloud & Enterprise

Explores remote execution environments, workspace collaboration, policy enforcement, and centralized orchestration using Terraform Cloud capabilities relevant to enterprise DevOps teams.

---

### 9. Terraform Challenges

Scenario-driven exercises designed to reinforce cumulative learning.
Encourages troubleshooting, architectural thinking, and applying multi-topic concepts to simulate real-world deployment situations.
